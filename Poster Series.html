            <p class="">  The first poster displays playing cards designed by taking inspiration from the Rococo Movement. The period is known for
                    its heavy ornamentation and pastel colour palette. It is considered rather whimsical. I particularly took inspiration from the architecture and furniture of
                    the time for designing the cards. </p>

        </div>
         <div class="conatiner col-6  align-content-start">
            <p class=""> The second product is designed taking inspiration form  post Impressionism. It was predominantly a French art movement that  broke free from the naturalism of Impressionism. I Focused on the style of Henri Matisse. He moved further away
                from the need for realistic representation, experimenting with creating a sense of balance and pleasure in his
                paintings. In his artworks, the human figure are central and manipulated.
                I chose to design concert tickets. The Band i chose is Les Six, which itself is a post impressinist
                band. The Design of the Ticket is inspired by their most famous composition “Les mariés de la tour Eiffel” (The
                Wedding Party on the Eiffel Tower). </p>

                <h3 class=" subhead float-end"> Matchbox - Neoclassicism</h3>
        </div>
         <div class="conatiner col-6  align-content-start">
            <p > I designed the match taking inspiration for the Neoclassicism Movement. Neoclassical architecture is defined as the “revival of classical architecture during the
                18th and early 19th centuries.” It is a distinct architectural style that references elements
                of classical antiquity—mostly ancient Greek and Roman architecture—that flourished
                throughout Western countries, particularly in Europe and the United States.
                For my design, I chose the Lincoln Memorial built from 1914 to 1922. It is a Classical block
                building. Block buildings typically have exterior columns and flat roofs. These neoclassical
                structures are also designed around a square or rectangular floor plan.
                For the colour palette I took inspiration from the paintings of the time. I noticed the
                prominent use of reds, blues, greens and yellows.
                I wanted the design to have a vintage feel typical to that of a matchbox. For the layout I
                kept it simple and harmonious, which are one of the key elements of the architectural
                style. </p>
